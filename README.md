This repository contains code built by the Eiler Lab to process Orbitrap data 

Please follow the guidelines below to contribute new code to the repository:
(1) create a project specific folder, and add your code to it
(2) add a readme to describe the contents of the folder
(3) use zenodo to publish a release and create an associated DOI, instructions here: https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/. This DOI will enable users to access a specific version of the code, all stored within the global repository
(4) If you would like, you can add an entry for the created DOI into the Caltech Library (data.caltech.edu)
(5) add a description of your added code below to the "Contents of the repository" list.

Conventions for adding to the repository:
- Please only add code relevant to community data processing activities. Any other code (e.g., models for your project) or raw data should be included in a separate DOI/folder
- Please only add *tested and verified* code. It should be well commented and easy for others to follow.
