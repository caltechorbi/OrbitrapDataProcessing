(1) create a project specific folder, and add your code to it <br />
(2) add a readme to describe the contents of the folder<br />
(3) add your author information and ORCID to the codemeta.json so your information can be associated to the new repository via CaltechDATA <br />
(4) publish a release. this will trigger CaltechDATA to create an associated DOI, which will enable users to access a specific version of the code, all stored within the global repository<br />
(5) add a description of your added code below to the "Contents of the repository" list.<br />

Conventions for adding to the repository:
